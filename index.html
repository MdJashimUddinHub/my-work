    <p><b>My work is coming soon</b>In the 16th century, an age of great marine and terrestrial exploration, Ferdinand
        Magellan led the first expedition to sail around the world. As a young Portuguese noble, he served the king of
        Portugal, but he became involved in the quagmire of political intrigue at court and lost the kingâ€™s favor. After
        he was dismissed from service by the king of Portugal, he offered to serve the future Emperor Charles V of
        Spain.</p>
    
    <p><b>New updates</b>A papal decree of 1493 had assigned all land in the New World west of 50 degrees W longitude to
        Spain and all the land east of that line to Portugal. Magellan offered to prove that the East Indies fell under
        Spanish authority. On September 20, 1519, Magellan set sail from Spain with five ships. More than a year later,
        one of these ships was exploring the topography of South America in search of a water route across the
        continent. This ship sank, but the remaining four ships searched along the southern peninsula of South America.
        Finally they found the passage they sought near 50 degrees S latitude. Magellan named this passage the Strait of
        All Saints, but today it is known as the Strait of Magellan.</p>
